This is a prototype focusing on the interaction between the user and the interface. The idea was inspired by the spell checkers and the auto correct functions in the computer operation system. I want to find out how people's feelings may change by this method, as well as how exchanging the vocabulary that used in the sentence could moderate the conversation.

#### **2016 presidential election as the theme**

The default setting of the comments that react to the userâ€™s input is in the position that hates the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton. Since the user testing for this prototype was located in the area that most users were from the standpoint that against Donald Trump in the New York City in 2016, the orientation was designed to fulfill the situation in considering the certain timing, culture of the social circle, and the political tendency.
